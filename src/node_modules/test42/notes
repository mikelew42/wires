Option:  Display UI? --> Wait until document.ready to run tests.
	- No need to wrap tests in doc.ready handler...
	- Just queue tests internally


Live running: 
- deactivate (remove old view, and... cleanup?)
- clear console
- rerun selected test(s)

How do we render back into the right container?  Originally, it's done via an app-level append to body.  I suppose that would work for now..

I need major overhauls of this whole system...
