I NEED TO MINIMIZE THE CALL STACK SIZE, OR THERE WILL BE MAXIMUM STACK SIZE ERRORS
Just let the original calls to fall through, before they're caught with the root, rather than continuing to call .exec before the last one finished...

!!!!!!!!


/// doesn't work for async testing (mainly because our main output is the console, and grouping would get all wonky)
// doesn't work (yet) for automated testing - you have to visually inspect the console to see the errors.

var test = require("test42");

test("one", function(){});

and either use the test42-server, or your own webpack/browserify...


Test objects are views, and have this.$el available, if you want to append anything.
As a View, the test class will have the standard views available:
- h1-h6, p, list? this can change...
- view({ tag: "whatever" })



# What happened to the test tests?


Before working on polishing these up,

1) Do I need to publish them?

What if I just make my site with it.  Isn't that evidence enough?

What happened to the web animation stuff?
- I could definitely make some walk cycles, jump animations, etc...
- Make some illustrations, and have them come to life.

Creating scenes that look right could take a really long time, however.

Just making a legit site with some decent UI/animations should be enough..?



What's the harm publishing these?
- It's impressive
- I might gain some support

Do I need to open source it?

I can't really make any demands right off the bat.  The framework will take time to establish itself as a contender.

And, it won't establish itself without an MIT license.

That's probably the best way to go.. to blast off a bit.  Get some recognition.  Get a better job.  Maybe get to work on my stuff.  It's pretty much a win win.  The only downside is that I can't use it to..?

I can't really protect the code... 

What if I don't worry about it?

A major concern is that once I allow contributions, then I'm not in full control anymore.  


Would I ever need to close the source?
Once it's published, its published... Someone somewhere will git clone it, and you can't take it back.  I can leave it un-licensed, which might not be a bad idea...

Ok, how about this:

I create a few standalone pieces that I can publish, but they could have obfuscated code.  Muahaha.  There it is.



## Publish a few libraries, but mask how they really work.

Things like the .set() algorithm, the ModFn, Logger, auto wrapped module, Views, etc...  Some of the better pieces of functionality, could remain off the table.  I could just publish a simple Base class, that just uses assign..?

I can then state that I've used this Base class to make the Test runner (link to it), the Logger (see it in action, inside the Test pages), the Views (see it in action with the whole site), etc.


Ok, but more importantly, I need to work on the views, css, page layouts, building a theme, typography, getting content rolling, etc.
