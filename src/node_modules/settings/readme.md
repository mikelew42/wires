- Make .set check if !hasOwn when setting against a referential value (obj, arr, etc);
- If !hasOwn, copy it to protect the prototype chain

Then, we can have a mod.settings object that automatically gets copied whenever you .set/modify it.  This allows similar inheritance to standard prototype inheritance, except its not "live".


# .settings is a sandboxed POJO, with only a .set method

Whenever .settings are .set, they are automatically saved (persisted).
Maybe we have an .xset, that's the default set, to bypass the saving, for code-generated settings that will run every time.

Then, we'll load the .settings from localStorage automatically, using .xset to override the defaults with the saved state (and bypass re-saving...)
