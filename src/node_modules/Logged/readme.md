Module.extend({
	my_method: method(function(){

	}, {
		collapse: true
	})
});

What if the default, "auto" expand/collapse state was the opposite of its parent, until you override it?

That could get annoying..

Or maybe it defaults to collapsed for root-level logs, and then all contents are expanded...?


What if I skip the console.logger?
The HTML logger has much greater flexibility...
I'm very limited with what I can do with the console logger
But, I don't have to worry about recursive bullshit...

The HTML logger could be a long journey.
What if they worked together?  Especially for test cases - we can isolate one small bit of code, and see it in the console...

USE HTML LOGGING FOR HIGHER-LEVEL STUFF
Then, you don't need to log all that stuff... Suppress it until there's a problem.

Dual approach is best...
